# System-Commands-course

I recently saw notes of `System Command` couse entirely in markdown. So I wrote a python script to convert `Markdowns` to `HTMLs`  and decorated them with CSS.
For the cherry on the cake I used `flask` library to produce dynamic header which automatically enlist link to all files in the header menu.


Please do check out and let me know any suggestion through GitHub comments/issues/pull requests.

It will be nice if we can seperate notes into folders (and so topics) while preserving the responsiveness of website. Can somebody help me to do this.
